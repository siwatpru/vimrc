## ðŸ•¹ Plugin and key mapping
Here are some of the plugins installed with this setup and the basic 
of how to use them.

> `<Leader>` is mapped to `,`

### Nerdtree
This plugin provides a file system explorer for the Vim. Use `<ctrl> + T`
to toggle the file explorer. `?` to open NERDTree quick help.

### vim-trailing-whitespace
This plugin causes all trailing whitespace to be highlighted in red.
You can also call `:FixWhitespace` to remove all the stupid white
spaces! ðŸ˜Ž

### vim-easymotion
This plugin provides awesome ways to move around in Vim. For example,
if you want to move the word `awesome`, all you need to do is press
`<Leader> s` follow by `a`

### vim-prettier
This is the vim plugin for the awesome code formatter
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) Use `<Leader> p`
to format the file.

### vim-commentary
This plugin makes commenting out stuff much easier. Use `gcc` to
comment out a line. `gc` can be followed by a motion, such as `gcap`
to comment out the whole paragraph. And with `vim-repeat` installed,
`.` can be used to repeat the command as well.

### vim-surround
This plugin is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes,
XML tags, and more. It's easiest to explain with examples. Follow the
link [here](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

This is a vim plugin for the fuzzy finder `fzf` which is ðŸ”¥BlazinglyðŸ”¥ fast.
Here are some of mapping for this plugin:

- `<ctrl> + p` finding files in the project
- `<Leader> + b` finding opened buffers

### vim-startify
